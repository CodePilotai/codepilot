    <h3>
      CodePilot.ai is going Open Source!
      <hr class="border-b-2 border-grey-dark">
    </h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      After 2 years of work, 36 releases, 23,000+ installs and more queries than we can count we are happy to report
      that we are Open Sourcing CodePilot.ai.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      You will have more options and flexibility, also more privacy. Search is not a solved problem for software
      developers, we need many more tools and approaches, we hope CodePilot.ai is something that starts the journey to
      better search for software developers.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      We are posting the repo on <a class="text-indigo-light" href="https://github.com/CodePilotai/codepilot">GitHub</a>
      head on over and
      give it a star!
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      The project was built using <a class="text-indigo-light" href="https://github.com/electron/electron">Electron</a>
      and
      <a class="text-indigo-light" href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue.js</a>
      and is some very good clean code (Built by a team of very
      dedicated developers + two Vue.js core team members).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      We have provided documentation and assistance right in the repo so feel free to get involved, create your own
      build, open an issue, or submit a PR.
    </p>

    <h3>What this means for you</h3>
    <hr class="border-b-2 border-grey-dark">
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      Our final official release 5.0 has some functionality disabled (youtube, stackoverflow and github), to enable it
      you will need to provide a few API keys in services.config.js and create your own build.<br> Any developer may
      customize the software we have built, you can add features, remove features, change text to localize the app.
      Really the sky is the limit! And while we would love to incorporate your brilliance into the Master branch of
      CodePilot.ai you are free to make your own derivative works, even make your own solution from what we have
      delivered - you have tons of flexibility <a class="text-indigo-light" href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html">MIT
        License line-by-line</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What it means for us</h3>
    <hr class="border-b-2 border-grey-dark">
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      We have always wanted to build our tool within the Open Source space but policies and legalities being what they
      are we never pursued this pathway. We are releasing this to the community in the hope that the foundations we
      have laid might be leverages for greater things in the future. We built CodePilot.ai on the shoulders of many
      Open Source giants and we hope that you might build on what we have provided. Our team will no longer be formally
      working on CodePilot.ai.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I stay informed?</h3>
    <hr class="border-b-2 border-grey-dark">
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      We will continue to respond to email, simply contact us at Team@CodePilot.ai.
    </p>

    <h3>An end to our monetary support for Open Source :(</h3>
    <hr class="border-b-2 border-grey-dark">
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-normal">
      We must also discontinue our support for Open Source products that we use, this is a huge blow to us and we wish
      we had the funds to continue. Over the last year we have provided funds to 20+ Open Source projects with over
      $18,500 USD to the cause.
